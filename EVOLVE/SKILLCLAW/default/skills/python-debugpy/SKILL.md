# Python Debugger (pdb + debugpy)

## Overview

Three tools, picked by situation:

| Tool | When |
|---|---|
| **`breakpoint()` + pdb** | Local, interactive, simplest. Add `breakpoint()` in the source, run normally, get a REPL at that line. |
| **`python -m pdb`** | Launch an existing script under pdb with no source edits. Useful for quick poking. |
| **`debugpy`** | Remote / headless / "attach to already-running process." Talks DAP, scriptable from terminal, works for long-lived processes (gateway, daemon, PTY children). |

**Start with `breakpoint()`.** It's the cheapest thing that works.

## When to Use

- A test fails and the traceback doesn't reveal why a value is wrong
- You need to step through a function and watch a collection mutate
- A long-running process (hermes gateway, tui_gateway) misbehaves and you can't restart it
- Post-mortem: an exception fired in prod-ish code and you want to inspect locals at the crash site
- A subprocess / child (Python `_SlashWorker`, PTY bridge worker) is the actual bug site

**Don't use for:** things `print()` / `logging.debug` solve in under a minute, or things `pytest -vv --tb=long --showlocals` already reveals.

## pdb Quick Reference

Inside any pdb prompt (`(Pdb)`):

| Command | Action |
|---|---|
| `h` / `h cmd` | help |
| `n` | next line (step over) |
| `s` | step into |
| `r` | return from current function |
| `c` | continue |
| `unt N` | continue until line N |
| `j N` | jump to line N (same function only) |
| `l` / `ll` | list source around current line / full function |
| `w` | where (stack trace) |
| `u` / `d` | move up / down in the stack |
| `a` | print args of the current function |
| `p expr` / `pp expr` | print / pretty-print expression |
| `display expr` | auto-print expr on every stop |
| `b file:line` | set breakpoint |
| `b func` | break on function entry |
| `b file:line, cond` | conditional breakpoint |
| `cl N` | clear breakpoint N |
| `tbreak file:line` | one-shot breakpoint |
| `!stmt` | execute arbitrary Python (assignments included) |
| `interact` | drop into full Python REPL in current scope (Ctrl+D to exit) |
| `q` | quit |

The `interact` command is the most powerful — you can import anything, inspect complex objects, even call methods that mutate state. Locals are read-only by default; use `!x = 42` from the `(Pdb)` prompt to mutate.

## Recipes, Hermes Specifics, Pitfalls (read on trigger)

The five debugging recipes (local breakpoint, pdb launch, pytest
`--pdb`, post-mortem, remote debugpy with all three patterns and
client options), the Hermes-specific process debugging
(`run_agent.py`, `tui_gateway`, `_SlashWorker`, gateway), the 9
common pitfalls, and the one-shot recipes live in
`references/recipes-and-pitfalls.md`. Load it when actively
debugging. The tool-selection table and pdb command reference stay
above.

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] After `pip install debugpy`, confirm: `python -c "import debugpy; print(debugpy.__version__)"`
- [ ] For remote debug, confirm the port is actually listening: `ss -tlnp | grep 5678`
- [ ] First breakpoint actually hits (if it doesn't, you likely have `PYTHONBREAKPOINT=0`, you're under a parallel/capturing runner, or execution finished before attach)
- [ ] `where` / `w` shows the expected call stack
- [ ] Post-debug cleanup: no stray `breakpoint()` / `set_trace()` in committed code
  ```bash
  rg -n 'breakpoint\(\)|set_trace\(|debugpy\.listen' --type py
  ```
