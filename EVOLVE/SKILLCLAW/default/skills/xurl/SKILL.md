# xurl — X (Twitter) API via the Official CLI

`xurl` is the X developer platform's official CLI for the X API. It supports shortcut commands for common actions AND raw curl-style access to any v2 endpoint. All commands return JSON to stdout.

Use this skill for:
- posting, replying, quoting, deleting posts
- searching for raw posts (actual post JSON with IDs you can engage with) and reading timelines/mentions
- liking, reposting, bookmarking
- following, unfollowing, blocking, muting
- direct messages
- media uploads (images and video)
- raw access to any X API v2 endpoint
- multi-app / multi-account workflows

This skill replaces the older `xitter` skill (which wrapped a third-party Python CLI). `xurl` is maintained by the X developer platform team, supports OAuth 2.0 PKCE with auto-refresh, and covers a substantially larger API surface.

## Secret Safety (MANDATORY)

Critical rules when operating inside an agent/LLM session:

- **Never** read, print, parse, summarize, upload, or send `~/.xurl` to LLM context.
- **Never** ask the user to paste credentials/tokens into chat.
- The user must fill `~/.xurl` with secrets manually on their own machine. In Docker, this must be the `~` seen by Hermes tool subprocesses; see the Docker note below.
- **Never** recommend or execute auth commands with inline secrets in agent sessions.
- **Never** use `--verbose` / `-v` in agent sessions — it can expose auth headers/tokens.
- To verify credentials exist, only use: `xurl auth status`.

Forbidden flags in agent commands (they accept inline secrets):
`--bearer-token`, `--consumer-key`, `--consumer-secret`, `--access-token`, `--token-secret`, `--client-id`, `--client-secret`

App credential registration and credential rotation must be done by the user manually, outside the agent session. After credentials are registered, the user authenticates with `xurl auth oauth2` — also outside the agent session. Tokens persist to `~/.xurl` in YAML. Each app has isolated tokens. OAuth 2.0 tokens auto-refresh.

## Installation

Pick ONE method. On Linux, the shell script or `go install` are the easiest.

```bash
# Shell script (installs to ~/.local/bin, no sudo, works on Linux + macOS)
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xdevplatform/xurl/main/install.sh | bash

# Homebrew (macOS)
brew install --cask xdevplatform/tap/xurl

# npm
npm install -g @xdevplatform/xurl

# Go
go install github.com/xdevplatform/xurl@latest
```

Verify:

```bash
xurl --help
xurl auth status
```

If `xurl` is installed but `auth status` shows no apps or tokens, the user needs to complete auth manually — see the next section.

---

## One-Time User Setup (user runs these outside the agent)

These steps must be performed by the user directly, NOT by the agent, because they involve pasting secrets. Direct the user to this block; do not execute it for them.

1. Create or open an app at https://developer.x.com/en/portal/dashboard
2. Set the redirect URI to `http://localhost:8080/callback`
3. Copy the app's Client ID and Client Secret
4. Register the app locally (user runs this):
   ```bash
   xurl auth apps add my-app --client-id YOUR_CLIENT_ID --client-secret YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET
   ```
5. Authenticate (specify `--app` to bind the token to your app):
   ```bash
   xurl auth oauth2 --app my-app
   ```
   (This opens a browser for the OAuth 2.0 PKCE flow.)

   If X returns a `UsernameNotFound` error or 403 on the post-OAuth `/2/users/me` lookup, pass your handle explicitly (xurl v1.1.0+):
   ```bash
   xurl auth oauth2 --app my-app YOUR_USERNAME
   ```
   This binds the token to your handle and skips the broken `/2/users/me` call.
6. Set the app as default so all commands use it:
   ```bash
   xurl auth default my-app
   ```
7. Verify:
   ```bash
   xurl auth status
   xurl whoami
   ```

After this, the agent can use any command below without further setup. OAuth 2.0 tokens auto-refresh.

> **Common pitfall:** If you omit `--app my-app` from `xurl auth oauth2`, the OAuth token is saved to the built-in `default` app profile — which has no client-id or client-secret. Commands will fail with auth errors even though the OAuth flow appeared to succeed. If you hit this, re-run `xurl auth oauth2 --app my-app` and `xurl auth default my-app`.

> **Docker HOME pitfall:** In the official Hermes Docker layout, `/opt/data` is `HERMES_HOME`, but Hermes tool subprocesses use `/opt/data/home` as `HOME`. That means `~/.xurl` resolves to `/opt/data/home/.xurl` for Hermes-run `xurl` commands, not `/opt/data/.xurl`. Run the user setup with the same HOME:
> ```bash
> HOME=/opt/data/home xurl auth apps add my-app --client-id YOUR_CLIENT_ID --client-secret YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET
> HOME=/opt/data/home xurl auth oauth2 --app my-app YOUR_USERNAME
> HOME=/opt/data/home xurl auth default my-app YOUR_USERNAME
> HOME=/opt/data/home xurl auth status
> ```
> If `HOME=/opt/data xurl auth status` succeeds but `HOME=/opt/data/home xurl auth status` shows no apps or tokens, Hermes tool calls will not see the credentials.

## Quick Reference

| Action | Command |
| --- | --- |
| Post | `xurl post "Hello world!"` |
| Reply | `xurl reply POST_ID "Nice post!"` |
| Quote | `xurl quote POST_ID "My take"` |
| Delete a post | `xurl delete POST_ID` |
| Read a post | `xurl read POST_ID` |
| Search posts | `xurl search "QUERY" -n 10` |
| Who am I | `xurl whoami` |
| Look up a user | `xurl user @handle` |
| Home timeline | `xurl timeline -n 20` |
| Mentions | `xurl mentions -n 10` |
| Like / Unlike | `xurl like POST_ID` / `xurl unlike POST_ID` |
| Repost / Undo | `xurl repost POST_ID` / `xurl unrepost POST_ID` |
| Bookmark / Remove | `xurl bookmark POST_ID` / `xurl unbookmark POST_ID` |
| List bookmarks / likes | `xurl bookmarks -n 10` / `xurl likes -n 10` |
| Follow / Unfollow | `xurl follow @handle` / `xurl unfollow @handle` |
| Following / Followers | `xurl following -n 20` / `xurl followers -n 20` |
| Block / Unblock | `xurl block @handle` / `xurl unblock @handle` |
| Mute / Unmute | `xurl mute @handle` / `xurl unmute @handle` |
| Send DM | `xurl dm @handle "message"` |
| List DMs | `xurl dms -n 10` |
| Upload media | `xurl media upload path/to/file.mp4` |
| Media status | `xurl media status MEDIA_ID` |
| List apps | `xurl auth apps list` |
| Remove app | `xurl auth apps remove NAME` |
| Set default app | `xurl auth default APP_NAME [USERNAME]` |
| Per-request app | `xurl --app NAME /2/users/me` |
| Auth status | `xurl auth status` |

Notes:
- `POST_ID` accepts full URLs too (e.g. `https://x.com/user/status/1234567890`) — xurl extracts the ID.
- Usernames work with or without a leading `@`.

## Command Details & Workflows (read when executing)

The per-command examples (posting, reading/search, engagement, social
graph, DMs, media upload), raw API access, streaming, common
workflows, error handling, troubleshooting table, and notes live in
`references/command-details.md`. Load it when running a specific
action. The quick-reference table above covers the common ones
inline; the agent workflow below is the operating discipline.

## Agent Workflow

1. Verify prerequisites: `xurl --help` and `xurl auth status`.
2. Before using `xurl search`, check intent. Reach for it when the task needs actual post objects, authenticated account context, or leads into an X write action — it is the right surface when the user wants posts they can engage with, not just a summary of a topic.
3. **Check default app has credentials.** Parse the `auth status` output. The default app is marked with `▸`. If the default app shows `oauth2: (none)` but another app has a valid oauth2 user, tell the user to run `xurl auth default <that-app>` to fix it. This is the most common setup mistake — the user added an app with a custom name but never set it as default, so xurl keeps trying the empty `default` profile.
4. If auth is missing entirely, stop and direct the user to the "One-Time User Setup" section — do NOT attempt to register apps or pass secrets yourself.
5. Start with a cheap read (`xurl whoami`, `xurl user @handle`, `xurl search ... -n 3`) to confirm reachability.
6. Confirm the target post/user and the user's intent before any write action (post, reply, like, repost, DM, follow, block, delete).
7. Only the `xurl` command output (or the raw X API response) proves that a state-changing X action happened. Never report a write as done based on any other source — search results, summaries, or prior context.
8. Use JSON output directly — every response is already structured.
9. Never paste `~/.xurl` contents back into the conversation.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Auth errors after successful OAuth flow | Token saved to `default` app (no client-id/secret) instead of your named app | `xurl auth oauth2 --app my-app` then `xurl auth default my-app` |
| `unauthorized_client` during OAuth | App type set to "Native App" in X dashboard | Change to "Web app, automated app or bot" in User Authentication Settings |
| `UsernameNotFound` or 403 on `/2/users/me` right after OAuth | X not returning username reliably from `/2/users/me` | Re-run `xurl auth oauth2 --app my-app YOUR_USERNAME` (xurl v1.1.0+) to pass the handle explicitly |
| 401 on every request | Token expired or wrong default app | Check `xurl auth status` — verify `▸` points to an app with oauth2 tokens |
| `client-forbidden` / `client-not-enrolled` | X platform enrollment issue | Dashboard → Apps → Manage → Move to "Pay-per-use" package → Production environment |
| `CreditsDepleted` | $0 balance on X API | Buy credits (min $5) in Developer Console → Billing |
| `media processing failed` on image upload | Default category is `amplify_video` | Add `--category tweet_image --media-type image/png` |
| Two "Client Secret" values in X dashboard | UI bug — first is actually Client ID | Confirm on the "Keys and tokens" page; ID ends in `MTpjaQ` |

## Notes

- **Rate limits:** X enforces per-endpoint rate limits. A 429 means wait and retry. Write endpoints (post, reply, like, repost) have tighter limits than reads.
- **Scopes:** OAuth 2.0 tokens use broad scopes. A 403 on a specific action usually means the token is missing a scope — have the user re-run `xurl auth oauth2`.
- **Token refresh:** OAuth 2.0 tokens auto-refresh. Nothing to do.
- **Multiple apps:** Each app has isolated credentials/tokens. Switch with `xurl auth default` or `--app`.
- **Multiple accounts per app:** Select with `-u / --username`, or set a default with `xurl auth default APP USER`.
- **Token storage:** `~/.xurl` is YAML. In Docker, use the Hermes subprocess HOME (`/opt/data/home` in the official image) so tokens land under `/opt/data/home/.xurl`. Never read or send this file to LLM context.
- **Cost:** X API access is typically paid for meaningful usage. Many failures are plan/permission problems, not code problems.
